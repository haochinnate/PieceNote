# 10 resume do’s and don’ts for developers

文章來源: http://www.infoworld.com/article/3141949/it-careers/10-resume-dos-and-donts-for-developers.html

## Pre

Landing that dream developer job is hard work, but it all starts with the resume. 
Your code may be tight and you may have a wide range of deep experience, 
but if you shortchange the time spent on your resume, 
you may not get recognized in the job marketplace for your true worth. 
You might even sabotage your chance of being invited for interviews.

We spoke with recruiters and hiring managers to get a sense of what makes candidates break through the slush. 
They may not have heard of your current and past employers or products you have worked on, 
but if you present your accomplishments and skills in the right way, 
you can maximize your career opportunities in a hot job market.


## Dev resume don’t: Drown hiring managers in your details

Attention to detail is an essential trait for programmers, but it’s best not to overdo it on your resume.

“This year, I have seen multiple candidates with resumes over 10 pages long that are filled with technical details. 
Those resumes take a lot of work to understand. 
Unfortunately, some candidates list every technology they have ever interacted with on their resume,” 
explains Brandon Vince, ‎who works on strategic talent acquisition at Cisco.

In addition to losing hiring managers in your details, 
you also risk coming off as someone who can’t weigh the importance of your own work—a nonstarter for companies looking for programmers who can make a difference in prioritizing business goals. 
Your resume is meant to present you in the best light, not serve as a comprehensive transcript.

### 別用細節淹沒了人資 (Don't Drown hiring managers in your details)

專注於細節對於程式開發人員來說是個必要的特質，但在履歷表上最好不要表現得太過頭。

履歷表上放太多的技術面細節或所有接觸過的科技、技術，會使人資迷失在你的細節中，而且提高別人無法衡量你在工作上所占重要性的風險。

你的履歷表應該是要將你最好的部分表現出來，而非只是當作什麼無所不包的文字記錄/考試的成績報告單。


## Dev resume do: Provide business context

In working closely with a department or company, you become an insider. 
That’s helpful while you are at the company and have a shared reference point. 
On a resume, the insider perspective makes it difficult for hiring managers to understand your value.

“In many cases, candidates don’t describe what the company does or how they contributed to the company’s purposes,” explains Peter Yared, CTO at Sapho, a software firm that creates business micro apps. “I’ll see people write something like ‘programmed in Java for 6 years.’ There’s no context for what that programming achieved. Adding a sentence about the company like ‘built a reservation system for a vacation travel system’ helps.”

Including a short explanation that gives the business context and impact of your development work helps hiring managers fully understand your achievements, giving them not only a better view of your value but also insight as to how your efforts can help them achieve their own business goals.

### 

在一個部門或公司深入密切工作後，你會變成公司內部的人，非常了解內部的事情。當你在公司

熟悉內部的人
 
當你在公司裡面而且have a shared reference point參考標準是有幫助的。
 
但在履歷表上面，用內部員工的觀點可能會使召募人員難以知道你的價值。
 
"在許多案例中，應徵者沒有描述公司在做什麼或他們如何為公司的目標做出貢獻"
 
有些人會寫 "寫Java程式經驗6年"，但並沒有脈絡描述你寫的程式達成了什麼。
 
增加一些有關公司的句子，例如: "製作假期旅遊系統的預定功能"可以幫助多些了解。
 
為你的業務背景和開發工作對公司的影響增加簡短的解說，可以幫助人資、召募人員對你的成就有全盤的了解，這樣不僅讓他們可以對於你的價值有更好的觀點，也能從你的貢獻洞見出對他們達成經營目標將有什麼幫助。

## Dev resume don’t: List every technology you’ve ever touched

### 不要把你所有碰過的技術都列在履歷表上

Overwhelming hiring managers with material is only one problem with an excessively detailed resume. 
過度詳細的履歷表只是用素材壓垮招募人員的問題之一。

If you list a skill or technology on your resume, expect that you may be asked questions about it.

“I have seen candidates list Assembly on their resume, then struggle to answer questions about it during interviews,” 
explains Pablo Calamera, CTO at Vonage, a telecommunications company.

Rather than listing every programming language or product you've used, limit your resume to those skills where you have significant dexterity and expertise. Otherwise, you run the risk of embarrassing yourself in the interview.

“Listing numerous platforms and languages on a resume without clearly indicating your level of proficiency leads to problems. 
The applicant appears in a keyword search with that approach. 
However, once a hiring manager or recruiter connects with the developer, it doesn’t take long to find out there is a mismatch in terms of skills and expertise,” 

explains Marissa Peretz, founder of Silicon Beach Talent, a recruiting firm based in California.

如果你在履歷表上列了太多技能或是技術，你將會如預期的被問到很多相關的問題。
"我曾經看過一些應徵者在他們的履歷表上有寫組合語言，但卻在面試時對於相關問題回答不出來"
 
與其把每個你使用過的程式語言或產品列出來，不如將你的履歷表著重在那些你非常熟練而且專精的技能。
不然你可能有在面試時陷入尷尬的危機。

## Dev resume do: Calibrate your resume to the role 

Tailoring your resume to the tech prerequisites of a job listing is important, but so too is targeting the role. After all, the difference between a junior and senior developer often goes beyond years of experience.

“A senior developer at our agency likely only spends about 20 percent of their time directly writing code. The rest of the time, a typical day may include mentoring junior staff, working with project managers, and working with software architecture,” explains Jim Oxenford, mobile development manager at Tonic Design, a digital agency in Pennsylvania.

In other organizations, “senior iOS developer” may mean you have been on staff the longest. The best way to find out what these terms mean in various organizations is to read the job posting closely and reach out to your network for advice.

Your resume also needs to align with your career goals, such as whether you want to move to management. “If a person is searching for a management position, I’m looking for evidence they have tackled tough challenges, collaborated with other departments to solve complex problems, and otherwise shown leadership,” adds Silicon Beach Talent’s Peretz. Communicating this type of accomplishment on a resume is harder than compiling a list of technologies. That’s why candidates who take the extra effort stand out.

### 讓你的履歷表與應徵職務相匹配

Tailoring your resume to the tech prerequisites of a job listing is important, but so too is targeting the role.
After all, the difference between a junior and senior developer often goes beyond years of experience.
畢竟，資淺與資深的開發人員的差異不僅僅是年資而已。
“A senior developer at our agency likely only spends about 20 percent of their time directly writing code. The rest of the time, a typical day may include mentoring junior staff, working with project managers, and working with software architecture,” explains Jim Oxenford, mobile development manager at Tonic Design, a digital agency in Pennsylvania.
在我們部門裡面，資深開發人員大概只花他們百分之二十的時間再直接撰寫程式上面。一般日子其他時間可能包括指導資淺人員、與PM專案經理合作、以及處理軟體架構。

In other organizations, “senior iOS developer” may mean you have been on staff the longest. 
The best way to find out what these terms mean in various organizations is to read the job posting closely and reach out to your network for advice.
在其他組織裡面，資深iOS開發人員可能代表你是該組織裡工作最久的。
辨別這個職務在不同公司代表的意義最好的辦法就是仔細地閱讀此份工作的描述，並從你的人脈中詢問建議或打聽消息。

Your resume also needs to align with your career goals, such as whether you want to move to management. 
你的履歷表也必須要與你的職涯目標相吻合，例如你是否想要變成管理職。
“If a person is searching for a management position, I’m looking for evidence they have tackled tough challenges, collaborated with other departments to solve complex problems, and otherwise shown leadership,” 
如果有人在尋求一個管理位置的職缺，我會找尋他是否有處理困難挑戰、與其他部門合作解決複雜問題、或其他可以顯示、證明領導才能的跡象或證據。
adds Silicon Beach Talent’s Peretz. 
Communicating this type of accomplishment on a resume is harder than compiling a list of technologies. 
在履歷表上傳達這類領導方面的成就比條列出你所會的技術要來的難，這也是為什麼有花額外努力的求職者能夠脫穎而出。
That’s why candidates who take the extra effort stand out.


## Dev resume don’t: Try to game resume systems

### 別想試著要 game 履歷表系統/

In today’s systems-based hiring culture, keywords on your resume will make it discoverable,
but there is such a thing as too much optimization. 
在現今以電腦系統為主的徵人招募文化中, 在你履歷表中增加關鍵字能讓履歷表更容易找到，....


 
While it might seem like a good idea to create a resume meant to sparkle in the eyes of the machines, don’t.
雖然把履歷寫的可以讓機器系統 看起來是個好主意 ，但請別這麼做。

“At the end of the day, write the resume to be read by the hiring manager, not a system,” explains Calamera. 
"到最後，你的履歷"

“Some candidates go a bit crazy in loading up their resumes with acronyms – that approach obscures the individual’s true talents,” he adds.

"有些應徵者 對於在履歷上寫縮寫字有點陷入走火入魔，這個方式會 真實天分"

Years ago, Google’s search engine adjusted to aggressive keyword tactics. 
Likewise, hiring managers and recruiters can tell if you are going too far.
“If I’m searching for an iOS developer, I may search for ‘iOS’ and ‘Swift’ in a database, but that’s about it,” 
Calamera explains. “I have seen some resumes where there are long lists of keywords. 
I’m more interested in knowing how you overcame problems.”

## Dev resume do: Augment with code

It’s been said before, but its value is true: For some employers, open source contributions and related professional activities make a big difference. 

Sometimes it can even help you bypass those notorious programming tests.

“If a candidate links to significant code contributions on GitHub, we look at that. 

In some cases, it may be so good that we skip the coding challenge in the hiring process,” explains Cisco’s Vince.

Augmenting your resume with project code repositories is especially important if you are seeking to make a career change.

“If a candidate is working on learning Ruby on Rails in their spare time and publishes to a code repository, 

I would consider that even if their day job did not involve Ruby,” explains Vince.

If you are looking to change your career focus, public contributions are one strategy to pursue.

“Your problem solving abilities and process is highly important in addition to specific technical skills,” adds Calamera. 

If you overcame technical limitations or problems to ship a project, that’s a powerful message to share with employers.

### 用程式碼來加強你的履歷

雖然前面已經有提到了, 但是它確實很重要: 對於有些雇主 開源專案的貢獻和相關專業的活動 是讓你與眾不同的

有時候它甚至可以幫助你略過、跳過那些notorious程式測驗。

"如果求職者在GitHub上有重要的程式貢獻，我們會特別去看???。在某些情況，有可能程式很好，讓我們能夠略過招募過程中的程式問題", Cisco's Vince

當如果你要尋求生涯改變的時候，用專案的repositories來強化你的履歷會來的特別重要。

"如果求職者在空閒時間還額外學習Ruby on Rails並發佈code repository，就算他每天工作內容不包含Ruby，我也會考慮雇用他。", explains Vince

如果你正想改變職涯專精的領域，那麼從事為公開貢獻是你可以考慮追求的策略。

"除了特定的技術專長以外，你解決問題的能力與過程也是非常重要的。", adds Calamera

如果你為了完成專案克服了技術上的限制或是問題，這是非常值得與雇主分享的有力訊息。

## 不要因為滿足您過去已有的成就, 而忘記要精益求精、追求進步  

當你的履歷吸引到注意時，你可能會受邀去參加一些程式挑戰(coding challenge)來驗證你技術上的能力。

由於僱主和應徵者都努力地想要評估技術上的專業知識，所以這現在已經變成一個常見的慣例方式或手法。

當你把你的履歷表整理組織起來時，你需要意識到任何你在履歷上所提到的都將變成檢視的目標。


這句沒翻

包含了你辛苦做的小程式 因為實用的軟體只是程式挑戰的其中一個小部分。

That includes sweating the small stuff, as functional software is only part of the picture with a coding challenge.

錙銖必究 鑽牛角尖  冰山一角


"我會關注他們程式碼幾個品質項目 : 程式碼乾淨嗎? 是否有清楚的文件/註解說明? 是否有滿足使用者的需求?" commments Calamera.

你的實作方法同時也會顯示出，跟你一起工作的時候你可能會是什麼樣的同事。

"到了最後, 有一個好方法來測試程式的品質就是團隊的其他成員是否可以在你沒有解釋的情況下瞭解你的程式。" adds Oxenford.

> Dev resume don’t: Rest on your coding laurels

> If your resume attracts interest, you may be invited to a coding challenge to validate your technical skills. It has become a common practice because employers and candidates struggle to evaluate technical expertise. As you put together your resume, know that anything you include is subject to review. That includes sweating the small stuff, as functional software is only part of the picture with a coding challenge.

> “I look at their code for a few qualities: Is it clean? Is it well documented? Did it address the requirements?” comments Calamera.

> Your approach will also signal what you might be like to work with as a colleague. “At the end of the day, a good test for quality code is whether someone else on the team can understand it without your explaining it,” adds Oxenford.


## 考慮去拿個認證吧

正規的教育和證照能夠讓你的履歷更為突出，有時也代表能夠拓寬你的領域與視野。

"當一名軟體工程師正在尋找一份Cisco安全產品的工作時，具備Cisco的認證是有幫助的。", explains Vince.

著名的認證有 CCNA 與 CCNP。

"如果一個開發人員有CCIE的認證那就更令人驚奇了。" Vince adds.

"除了Cisco認證之外, 我注意到 Network+ 和 Security+ 的認證也可以證明具有產業知識" he adds.

雖然對於特定的開發相關認證能否為你帶來優勢仍有爭議，但如果你正打算尋找特定產業的工作， 

藉由取得認證來超越別人的期待，並證明你的興趣及專精是值得的。

> Dev resume do: Consider getting certified

> Formal education and certifications play a role in setting your resume apart, and sometimes that means broadening your scope.

> “If a software engineer is looking to work on Cisco’s security products, it helps to have Cisco certifications,” explains Vince. Certifications of note include the CCNA and CCNP. “If a developer has the CCIE certification, that’s amazing,” Vince adds. “Beyond Cisco certifications, I also take note of Network+ and Security+ certifications to demonstrate industry knowledge,” he adds.

> While it’s still under debate whether dev-specific certifications will give you an edge, if you are looking to work within a specific industry, going the extra mile to prove your interest and acumen can be worthwhile.

## 不要為了證照而考試

雖然把證照放在履歷上可以有所幫助，但你的動機與目標才是更重要的。

"如果一個求職者有數張證照，我會問他們: 他們如何應用、使用這門學問? 

證照是否有與他們的工作及職涯相符合? 證照如何幫助他們的事業?" comments Vince

漫無目的為了學習而學習有其價值，但對雇主來說，如果能表現出你如何使用你的新知識、新學問會來的更有說服力。

如果你證照已經是很久以前拿到的，要仔細思考一下把它擺在履歷表中是否有意義。

畢竟你很有可能在面試的時候被詢問到相關的問題。

> Dev resume don’t: Certify for the sake of certification

> While certifications can help, your motivations and objectives count more.

> “If a candidate has multiple certifications, I ask about them: What did they do with this knowledge? How does it fit with their work and career?” comments Vince.

> Learning for learning’s sake has value, yet the learning is more compelling for an employer if you can show what you did with your new knowledge. If you earned a certification a long time ago, think carefully about whether it makes sense to include it. After all, you may be asked questions about it during an interview.

## Dev resume do: Reflect

### Reflect 效法反思?

The most effective resumes convey a career plan. 

最有效/最令人印象深刻的履歷是能傳達你的工作計畫/生涯規劃。

When putting together your resume, it’s important to reflect on your career progression 

and whether you are meeting your needs so that you can tailor your resume toward getting to your next step.


當把你的履歷表整合起來看時/綜觀你的履歷表全部時，顯現出你的
職業生涯發展演進  和  你是否遇到你所需要的能讓你的履歷合適地往你下一個目標邁進是非常重要的。
你是否找到能夠讓你的履歷合適地往你下一個目標邁進的需求是非常重要的

Here, having a goal that goes beyond a job description is essential, 

whether it’s to move to a management role, to go deeper in a more technical position, 

or to shift to a new domain, industry, or profession.

在這部分，有一個超越工作描述以外的目標是必要的。

無論是朝管理職邁進、精進為更資深的技術人員、轉換到新的領域、產業或專業。

Once you have a sense of your path, tap your network to find friends or colleagues in roles similar to your target. 

當你對你的職涯規劃有方向或想法sense時，在你的人脈裡面去尋找與你願景目標中的角色相似的朋友或同事


Their tales of how they came to be where they are will provide insights as to 

how you should polish your resume in service of your goal.

他們如何一路走到現在地位的心路歷程可以做為洞察、線索，讓你知道為了達到你的目標，你該如何讓你的履歷更完美、更精煉。
