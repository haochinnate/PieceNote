## Problem First, then find patterns 

* U Don't want to say: I need to learn 4 patterns, don't learn those and then say "how can I apply those patterns to my application"
* Which u want to do: when you're building your application and see a pain point, then look and see is there a pattern that can make my life easier in this situation  
* YOU had the problem first, then came up with a solution using a pattern. 
* Look at your problem, identify your problem, then go see if you can find a solution in the patterns or principles
